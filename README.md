# DSA Chat Assistant

A responsive, AI-powered teaching assistant for Data Structures and Algorithms problems. This web application allows users to submit a LeetCode problem URL along with their doubt and receive guided hints, approaches generated by OpenAI's GPT model. The application features a modern chat interface with a soothing blue/pink color palette and supports Markdown-formatted responses for improved readability.

## Setup Instructions

### Frontend (Client)

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/poojatalele/dsa-chat-assistant.git
   cd dsa-chat-assistant/client
2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
3. **Run the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm start

### Backend (Server)

1. **Navigate to the Server Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd ../server

2. **Create a `.env` file:**

  Create a file named .env in the server folder with the following content (replace your_openai_api_key_here with your actual API key):
  
   ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    PORT=5000
```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install

4. **Run the Backend Server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
The server will run at http://localhost:5000

## Architecture Overview

The **DSA Chat Assistant** application is divided into two main parts:

### Frontend (Client)

- **Built with React:**  
  The client manages the user interface and conversation state.

- **Key Components:**
  - **ChatApp.js:**  
    The main component that renders the chat interface. It maintains the conversation state (an array of messages), sends the entire conversation to the backend when a new message is submitted, and displays messages using the ChatMessage component. It also incorporates the ChatInput component for user input.
  - **ChatInput.js:**  
    Handles user input. Users type their questions or doubts into the input field (with support for submitting via Enter or clicking the Send button), and the component passes the message to ChatApp.js.
  - **ChatMessage.js:**  
    Renders individual chat bubbles. Each message is displayed as a bubble, with the assistant’s messages (rendered on the left) and user messages (rendered on the right). This component uses `react-markdown` to parse and display any Markdown formatting in the GPT responses.

- **Styling:**  
  The user interface is styled with CSS files using a soothing blue/pink color palette. The layout is responsive, ensuring a pleasant experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Backend (Server)

- **Built with Node.js and Express:**  
  The backend handles API requests from the frontend and integrates with OpenAI's GPT model.

- **Key File:**
  - **index.js:**  
    Defines an API endpoint (`/api/chat`) that receives the conversation (an array of messages) from the frontend. It constructs a prompt by combining a system message with the conversation history, sends this prompt to OpenAI’s Chat Completion API, and returns the GPT-generated hint as a JSON response.

- **Security:**  
  Sensitive data (such as the OpenAI API key) is stored in environment variables, ensuring that credentials are not exposed in the codebase.

## Usage Guidelines

### Initial Prompt
- **When the application loads**, an input field is displayed for user's first question.

### Chat Conversation
- **User messages** appear as chat bubbles aligned to the right.
- **GPT (assistant) responses** appear as chat bubbles aligned to the left, rendered with Markdown.

### Continuing the Conversation
- Users can continue typing follow-up questions in the input area.
- The complete conversation history is maintained and sent to the backend for **context-aware** responses.
- The assistant is designed to provide **hints, structured guidance, and potential pitfalls** but will **not** provide complete solutions or code. If the user requests code, the assistant politely refuses and emphasizes learning through hints.

## GPT Integration Details

### Message Submission
- The **ChatInput** component captures the user’s message and passes it to **ChatApp**.

### Sending Conversation to the Backend
- **ChatApp** maintains the conversation as an array of messages (`role`, `content`, etc.).
- When a new message is sent, the **entire** conversation history is forwarded via a **POST** request to the backend endpoint (`/api/chat`).

### Backend Processing
- In `server/index.js`, the backend receives the conversation, appends a **system message** that instructs GPT to act as a teaching assistant without providing full solutions or code, and sends this combined prompt to OpenAI's Chat Completion API.
- The API returns a GPT-generated hint (rather than a complete solution), which the backend sends back as JSON (with a `hint` property).

### Rendering the Response
- The frontend receives the GPT response and appends it to the conversation.
- **ChatMessage** uses `react-markdown` to render any Markdown formatting in the GPT response, ensuring headings, bullet points, and code blocks appear correctly (when relevant).
